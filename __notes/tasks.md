Perfect! 🚀 You want a **step-by-step roadmap** where each task is atomic, self-contained, and descriptive enough so that if you paste it back, we can implement it together. I’ll keep it clean, minimal, but scalable enough for your AI bot backend.

Here’s the **atomic task list** for building your FastAPI backend and deploying it to your VPS:

---

### 📝 Atomic Task List

#### **1. Project Setup**

1. **Initialize FastAPI project with a clean structure** → create folder layout (`app/`, `core/`, `routers/`, `models/`, `services/`, `utils/`). [**]
2. **Set up a Python environment & dependencies** → install `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `motor`, `beanie`, `python-jose`, `passlib`, etc. [*]
3. **Configure app settings using Pydantic BaseSettings** → for environment variables (DB URL, JWT secret, etc.). [*]

---

#### **2. Database & ORM**

4. **Connect FastAPI to MongoDB with Beanie ODM** → define a base document and connect at startup.
5. **Create a User model in MongoDB** → with fields like `id`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `created_at`.
6. **Implement Beanie migration setup** → so schema changes can be applied.

---

#### **3. Auth System**

7. **Add password hashing utility** → with `passlib`.
8. **Implement JWT creation & verification** → with `python-jose`.
9. **Build User signup & login routes** → store users in Mongo, issue JWT tokens.
10. **Protect routes with JWT authentication dependency** → e.g., `/me` endpoint.

---

#### **4. File Upload**

11. **Add file upload endpoint** → save files to local storage (`/uploads` folder).
12. **Serve uploaded files statically** → configure FastAPI to serve from `/uploads`.

---

#### **5. WebSockets**

13. **Add basic WebSocket endpoint** → client can connect and send/receive messages.
14. **Broadcast messages to multiple WebSocket clients** → manage connected clients in memory.

---

#### **6. Background Jobs**

15. **Integrate FastAPI BackgroundTasks** → for lightweight async jobs.
16. **Set up a Redis + Celery worker (or Dramatiq)** → for durable, retryable background jobs.
17. **Create a sample async task (e.g., saving logs or processing a file)**.

---

#### **7. CI/CD & Deployment**

18. **Write a Dockerfile for FastAPI app** → production-ready.
19. **Write a docker-compose.yml** → to run API + MongoDB (+ Redis if using worker).
20. **Set up GitHub Actions workflow** → build & push Docker image to VPS (or pull & restart container via SSH).
21. **Configure VPS (Ubuntu) for deployment** → install Docker, set up firewall, run stack.
22. **Set up Nginx reverse proxy with SSL (Let's Encrypt)** → to serve FastAPI securely at your domain.

---

#### **8. Extras**

23. **Add logging middleware** → structured logs for requests & errors.
24. **Add CORS middleware** → allow your bots/clients to call API.
25. **Add health check endpoint** → `/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
26. **Write simple test cases** → with `pytest` for users & auth.

---

✅ If you go through all these tasks one by one, you’ll end up with:

- A **FastAPI backend** with JWT auth, MongoDB, file uploads, WebSockets, background jobs.
- A **CI/CD pipeline** to deploy changes from GitHub to VPS.
- A **production-ready stack** behind Nginx + SSL.

Do you want me to **rewrite the list with task numbers only** (like a checklist), so you can paste one by one into me later?
